# SAR Change Dectection

Change detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a critical yet challenging task. Existing methods mainly focus on feature extraction in spatial domain, and little attention has been paid to frequency domain. Furthermore, in patch-wise feature analysis, some noisy features in the marginal region may be introduced. In this project, We used the DD-net based SAR change detection method proposed by the Gao Feng@summitgao team of Ocean University of China. 

In addition, team member Zhihao Zhao and I also jointly built the front and back end of the project, thus building a platform for SAR Change Dectection. The specific project introduction can be seen in the project demonstration video.
